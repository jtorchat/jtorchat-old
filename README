--------------

jTorchat stands for Java Torchat, and is a complete rewrite of the popular p2p IM messenger Torchat.

The underlying protocol of jtorchat is based on python Torchat http://code.google.com/p/torchat/

Philosophy

Accessible to All. Alive and connected to All. Transparent to All.
How we keep to these philosophy

   1. Accessible to All = Writing it in java allows for easy portability of code between platforms, perhaps even in android phones.
   2. Alive and connected to All = Broadcast feature, and eventually group chat, will provide talkers the ability to interact as a group, or as a public mass.
   3. Transparent to All = All jtorchat will come with the source, thus increasing transparency and thus security. 

Features from python Torchat

   1. Basic Messaging to Torchat users - Done
   2. Popup Alerts - Done
   3. Time Stamp - Done
   4. file transfer - Done
   5. Minimize to tray - Done
   6. Taskbar flashes on msg - How the hell do you do it in java, crossplatform? 

Features extended beyond python Torchat

   1. Auto buddy request - done - Helps newcomers find people to talk to
   2. nterface to existing installed tor via GUI - done
   3. Broadcast Mode - done - Allows a message to be sent to everyone in the network (no sender spoofing protection tho)
   4. BuddySync? - allows a group to always keep their buddies in sync over tor.
   5. Group Chat - Not Yet - For secure group communication.
   6. FileSharing? - allows for calling and downloading files off online buddies. 

Wishlist

   1. put budReq'd buddies into a different group
   2. move old buddies from the default group to 'Old buddies' group (but not removing them from user set groups)
